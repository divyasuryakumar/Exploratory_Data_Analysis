Exploratory_Data_Analysis
=========================
This is for the Coursera Class

The original dataset household_power_consumption.txt is 20Mb and should be saved in the working directory. The first 
R script namely plot1.R should be executed first as this will read the whole data first and 
then only the required dates are read from the data.

After the four files are executed there will be four graphs that will be created. 
The graphs are saved in .png format.

The following descriptions of the 9 + 1 variables in the dataset was taken from the UCI web site and then modified:
Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
Datetime: This combines the Date and the time fields (this is for the plot2.png)

Note: This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:

Yahoo! you have four awesome graphs ...
